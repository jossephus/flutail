## bringing tailwindcss's color System To Flutter

# Why

One thing I realized about css in the last  few months  was that having well defined color systems is very beneficial in your day to day workflow. Since tailwindcss has the best set of colors , using tailwindcss  has been a really really fun . having said that this is me trying to bring tailwindcss's color system to flutter.. It's about 100 lines of dart code generated from the default tailwindcss configuration file  using the go files above.

## HOW TO USE
just copy the tailwindColors.dart in ur project   and start using the color systems .. I don't want to make it a big deal packaging it up because it's just a bunch of constants ... 

## TODO
- a flag to grap the configuration file from the network 
- a flag to specify prefix to use for the constants 
- a program that walks through all dart files in a project and  filter the tail colors used and edit the tailwindColors file  
- do u know how awesome tailiwind shadows are?? what about them 
- the font sizes too.. Problem is dart doesn't know about rems.. we will figure that out
